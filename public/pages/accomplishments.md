# 🏆 Accomplishments

## ▶ The 2023 ICPC Asia Dhaka Regional Contest `(Hosted by Bangladesh University of Business & Technology)`

> - **Team Name:** NEUB_Believers.
> - **Rank:** 133th.
> - **Thoughts:** This was one of our best contests, but we could have done better!  
We finally got our favorite team: Arafat, Mamun, and I. My teammates were phenomenal. Initially, we had hoped to solve 4 to 5 problems. Unfortunately, it took a lot of our time to generate and test corner cases. However, we have to be satisfied with what we have, our couch was also satisfied with our performance. Nevertheless, if we could have solved the problems a bit earlier, we might have secured a better rank, like 63rd to 70th. This is because, starting from the 63rd position, teams also solved 3 problems, but they were faster.

## ▶ The 2022 ICPC Asia Dhaka Regional Contest `(Hosted by Green University Bangladesh)`

> - **Team Name:** NEUB_TeamXero.
> - **Rank:** 141th.
> - **Thoughts:** This was our the worst ICPC onsite to date. We did terrible in this contest. Tough, we were capable of solving 3 to 4 problem easily, but overconfidence and underconfidence got the better of us! We solved only one problem! It was like a nightmare. Nevertheless, that day we learnt something, we have to be better, smarter & efficient.  
It was a disaster, but we took it as an life lesson.
